Given an MxN matrix with blocked cells, count the paths starting from the top left ([0,0]) to get to the bottom right ([M, N]) without moving backward, i.e. only moving down or right in the grid.

The grid/matrix will be given as a matrix of 0's which can be passed, and 1's which indicate blocked cells.

EG:
```
[
    [0,0,1,0],
    [0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0],
    [1,0,0,0],
]
```
